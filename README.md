points, edit index.html and refresh the page.

## Standalone level editor (no "Save")

You can access the level editor in standalone mode here: http://artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape/level-editor/ but bear in mind it has nowhere to save your level, so you will need to copy and paste your creations as code to keep them!
