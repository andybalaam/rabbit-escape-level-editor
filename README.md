# Rabbit Escape Level Editor

A level editor for [Rabbit Escape](http://artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape).

Find new levels and create your own here: https://artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape/levels/

The level editor is written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), which is a cool language that compiles to JavaScript to be embedded in a web page.

To find out how to create levels, see https://www.artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape/create-levels.html

## Setup

[Install Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html), then run:

```bash
make setup
```

If that doesn't work, please create a new issue, because it should ;-)

## Test

```bash
make
```

Open index.html in a browser.  To try out different levels as starting
points, edit index.html and refresh the page.

## Standalone level editor (no "Save")

You can access the level editor in standalone mode here: http://artificialworlds.net/rabbit-escape/level-editor/ but bear in mind it has nowhere to save your level, so you will need to copy and paste your creations as code to keep them!
